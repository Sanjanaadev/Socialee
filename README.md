üåê Socialee - A Social Media Web Application
Socialee is a full-stack social media web application inspired by platforms like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads. It is designed to help users connect with friends, share posts, express moods, view temporary stories (snaps), and chat in real time. Built using React.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MongoDB for the database, Socialee brings together a range of social networking features into one cohesive platform.

The application includes a personalized and dynamic home feed that displays posts from people you follow. Each post supports interactions such as likes and comments, allowing users to engage meaningfully with content. Every user has a profile page where their posts are displayed along with follower and following counts. Users can also edit their profile and change their password.

A key feature of Socialee is the Snaps page, which functions similarly to WhatsApp Status or Instagram Stories. Here, users can upload temporary content‚Äîimages or videos‚Äîthat expire after a certain time. It helps in sharing moments without permanently storing them on the profile.

Another unique section is the Mood page, where users can post their thoughts in a short-text format, similar to Threads or Twitter. These posts can receive emoji reactions from friends, allowing lightweight and expressive communication beyond traditional comments.

Socialee also includes a real-time chat feature through the Message page. Users can initiate one-on-one conversations and exchange messages instantly, enhancing the feeling of connectedness on the platform. The messaging system may use technologies like WebSockets or polling depending on future expansion.

Users receive notifications for key interactions like post likes, comments, new followers, or incoming messages. These notifications are delivered in real time and can be accessed through a notification bell icon.

The application supports secure user authentication using JWT tokens. Features such as editing profile information and changing passwords are built into the settings, ensuring that users have full control over their accounts.

The frontend of Socialee is developed using React.js, offering a component-based, responsive, and interactive user interface.The backend is developed with Node.js and Express.js. It defines a set of RESTful APIs to handle user authentication, post creation, interactions, and messaging. Image uploads for posts and snaps are managed using Multer middleware. Mongoose is used for database interaction and schema management with MongoDB.

MongoDB serves as the main database, storing information about users, posts, messages, moods, snaps, and other related data. The structure is flexible and scalable, making it well-suited for dynamic content.

The project follows a structured folder layout separating frontend and backend logic. The frontend contains components, pages, contexts, and utilities to manage the UI. The backend includes models, routes, controllers, middleware, and utility functions. This separation ensures maintainability and scalability.

Future improvements include features like group chats, voice messages, filters and search in posts, mood categories, snap viewer stats, and story highlights.
